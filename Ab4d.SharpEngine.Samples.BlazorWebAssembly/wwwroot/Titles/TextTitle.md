# 3D Text

Ab4d.SharpEngine supports the following text rendering methods:

- **Vector text** is created from TrueType files (ttf). The engine generates the meshes by triangulating the curves that define the font.
- **Bitmap text** is created by using a font bitmap where the font characters are rendered to font texture. The engine then generates the meshes that show the characters from the font bitmap.
